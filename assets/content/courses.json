Value streams start with and focus specifically on business value provided to the customer.",

Drawing upon parallels from the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), many of the techniques that help with coordination and interconnection between Agile processes will also be shown effective at coordinating and delivering value at scale.\nIn this workshop you will partner and collaborate with other students representing a broad swath of your corporate know-how. Under the expert guidance of experienced facilitators, you will have the opportunity to immerse yourself in several actual business challenges and then learn how value stream coordination can help you manage the many competing requirements that may interfere with delivering value. You will have the opportunity to experience, practice, and apply new ways of thinking about delivering customer value. In demonstrations of complex organizations, you will see how these practices scale to meet your challenges.",

It is the summation of a set of sprints, and usually lasts 8-12 weeks.  The PI is the final artifact of the scrum framework, and represents a usable solution\nThis workshop guides participants through the process of defining the program increment, guiding its development cycle, and realizing its functionality through deployment.  Practicing Scrum without a program increment is merely wasted effort and a lost opportunity.  This customized workshop shows your team how to successfully define and deliver the PI.",
